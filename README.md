# passGenerator

## A quick look!

During this assignment, we are given some starter code that is not entirely functioning. Our goal in this challenge is to create a function that randomly generates a password under specific criteria. 

## How to Solve this:

I started by defining variables in javaScript in order to store the arrays for numbers, symbols, and the alphabet. I then make a different function that uppercases the alphebetical characters when called, naming that array alpha2. 

I the use a series of if, else if, and else statements to generate the password. Then I created a function in the password function to randomly assign different parts of the array in the array. 

## Conclusion

In short I used if and else if statements to assign the array for what ever conditions the password had to meet. I then made a generating function to actually create the password after the array was assigned. 

This allowed for any of the conditional statements to generate a new kind of password.
